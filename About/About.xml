Got energy?
Need storage space?
Infinite Storage is right for you!

The amount of energy required is based off the weight of the stored items in Infinite Storage.
I am currently tweaking energy/storage ratio and welcome input as I experiment. I have also made the ratio adjustable in Mod Settings.

There are two 'specialty' storage units: Body Parts and Textiles. These units are capable of storing Body Parts &amp; Medicine and Leather/Wool at without energy.
